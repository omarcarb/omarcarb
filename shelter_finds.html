        <h2 class="subheading">Project Summary</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Shelter Finds is a website for people looking to rent property. What makes Shelter Finds unique is the extensive list of rental properties available. From the common apartments to small container homes.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Problem That Needs To Be Solved</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Users want to find a property that fits their specific needs and lifestyle. Many websites offer such a service, but their selection is limited. Those that do offer a wide selection suffer from having too much available to the user. This causes stress among rental seekers and wastes valuable time.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">The Solution</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Create a website that offers a ton of filter options and make it easy to navigate.</p>

            <h1 class="section-header">Process to Product</h1>
            <p class="subtext">Most rental websites follow a simple 3 step formula for getting the  property the user wants. </p>
            <p class = "subtext">1. Search for properties in the immediate area.</p>
            <p class = "subtext">2. List qualities people in the area generally look for.</p>
            <p class = "subtext">3. Narrow the search results with filters (such as allowing pets in the rental property).</p>
            <p class="subtext">To deliver what the users would want, I had to come up with a way for users navigate the website. This also needs to accomplished while providing a wide variety of properties.</p>
            <p class = "subtext"> To accomplish this goal, I followed this methodology:</p>

        <h1 class="section-header">Ideation</h1>
        <p class="subtext">To allow for the display of tons of properties, I came up with several iterations of the website layout. I also wanted the images to be as prominent as possible for faster decision making. A lot of the early designs are inspired by websites such as Rent.com and Zillow.  I decided to go with this simplistic layout with a heavy emphasis on visuals.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Laying the Foundation</h2>
        <p class="subtext">Other rental websites go for a minimalistic aesthetic to convey a lot of information. While this is effective, its not very distinct from other website. As such, I went with a more Aurora Gradient aesthetic with soft gradients and vibrant colors. This helps the website stand out from others, while also giving visual feedback to the user.</p>
