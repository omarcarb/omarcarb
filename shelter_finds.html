        <h2 class="subheading">Project Summary</h2>
            <p class="subtext">A mobile app and website that alerts users to any incoming natural disasters and directs them to the proper resources, when they occur. The project was worked on from August 2022 - September 2022</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Problem That Needs To Be Solved</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Resources for notifying people of upcoming weather alerts are scarce and often unreliable. As cable news viewership declines, people have less awareness of dangerous weather events. </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">The Solution</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Design an app that delivers up to date notifications of upcoming weather events in their area or location of their choosing, and provide them with the resources they need to plan accordingly.</p>

            <h1 class="section-header">Process to Product</h1>
            <p class="subtext">Some assumptions were made when going into this project. I was aware that users wanted quick and easy access to the information that was most relevant to them. I also assumed most users would prefer such an application through their mobile devices. As such, I went with a mobile first design philosophy to better allow for smaller screens and provide things like pop-up notifications when something serious happens.</p>
            <p> The process to solving the problem went something like this</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h1 class="section-header">Ideation</h1>
        <p class="subtext">I wanted the app to look as neatly organized as possible to reduced information clutter while still delivering all the relevant information needed in any weather app.<br>Several design choices I made during the ideation phase were made with the idea that most people wanted their weather alerts first before they receive any general weather information</p>

        <h1 class="section-header">Design</h1>
        <h2 class="subheading">Laying the Foundation</h2>
        <p class="subtext">I went with a modern minimalism look to the app since I wanted to convey as much information as possible without creating too much visual noise. I went through several iterations before settling with a soft blue color pallete on an 8 point grid set-up and a Roboto font to display the information.</p>
