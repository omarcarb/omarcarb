                <p>The data reveals a notable decline in travel among individuals with disabilities, highlighting their restricted access to essential services and employment opportunities due to inadequate transportation options. The survey findings echo this, emphasizing the prevalent issue of limited accessibility for those with disabilities. <br><br>A potential solution facilitating access to para-transit services and comprehensive information on accessibility features could significantly alleviate these challenges, offering greater independence and improved access to necessary services for individuals with disabilities.</p>

                <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframe</h2>
                <p>After I have set up the flow for the users, I began making some low fidelity wireframes to establish a feel for the way the app would be designed, including various main elements that would be important to users to see.</p>

                <h2>High Fidelity Design</h2>
                <p>
                    After finalizing my low fidelity wireframe, I felt confident enough to begin making the look of the design really 
                    pop. I originally went with a minimalist look but after some time playing with different colors, fonts and 
                    styles, I ultimately went with a dark mode aesthetic as it was easier to present and the user would
                    have an easier time navigating the app.
