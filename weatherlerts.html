        <h2 class="subheading">Project Summary</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Weatherlerts is a mobile app project. It's designed to deliver early warning alerts to the user of any upcoming disasters. The project time was between August 2022 and September 2022.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Problem That Needs To Be Solved</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Resources for notifying people of upcoming weather alerts are scarce and often unreliable. As cable news viewership declines, people have less awareness of dangerous weather events. </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">The Solution</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Design an app that delivers up to date notifications of upcoming weather  events. It must also provide real time information for users about the local weather. And for the cherry on top, it must provide local resources, such as aide and emergency lines.</p>

            <h1 class="section-header">Process to Product</h1>
            <p class="subtext">I made some assumptions when going into this project. I was aware  that users wanted quick and easy access to the information that was most  relevant to them. I also assumed most users would prefer to view it through their mobile devices. As such, I went with a mobile  first design philosophy to better allow for smaller screens. This would allow me to provide  things like pop-up notifications or alerts. </p>
            <p class = "subtext"> The process to solving the problem went something like this</p>

        <p class="subtext">I wanted the app to look as neatly organized as possible to reduced information clutter while still delivering all the relevant information needed in any weather app.<br>Several design choices I made during the ideation phase were made with the idea that most people wanted their weather alerts first before they receive any general weather information</p>

        <p class="subtext">I went with a modern minimalism look to the app since I wanted to convey as much information as possible without creating too much visual noise. I went through several iterations before settling with a soft blue color pallete on an 8 point grid set-up and a Roboto font to display the information.</p>
