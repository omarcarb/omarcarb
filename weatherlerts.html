                    <p><strong>Enhancing the user experience requires further testing.</strong> Our discussions with project participants highlight their predominant use of weather apps for planning purposes. Thus, an intriguing concept could involve enabling the app to sync with their calendar and issue alerts regarding weather conditions that could potentially impact their plans.</p>

            <h2 class="subheading">In Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="subtext">While the market for personalized weather apps isn't as big as I expected, there's room for innovation. Many existing apps lack an integrated alert system. By filling this gap and adding alerts, we can greatly improve emergency readiness and user engagement, making the app even more valuable.</p>
