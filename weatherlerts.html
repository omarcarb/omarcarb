        <p class="subtext">I made some assumptions when going into this project. I was aware  that users wanted quick and easy access to the information that was most  relevant to them. I also assumed most users would prefer to view it through their mobile devices. As such, I went with a mobile  first design philosophy to better allow for smaller screens. This would allow me to provide  things like pop-up notifications or alerts. </p>

        <p class="subtext">My first iteration didn't go well with testing so I went back to the drawing board. I settled on an 8-point grid layout with a minimalist aesthetic. Colors are still a struggle for me so I decided a simple blue, to match the color of the sky, would be best for a base color. For typography, I went with the Roboto font since its most used in many designs. </p>

                <p><strong>More testing is required to improve the user experience. </strong>People that were interviewed for this project have said they normally don't use weather apps for anything other than planning. As such, a possible consideration to this project would be to add the capability to sync with ones calander and alert the user of possible weather that might affect their plans.</p>
